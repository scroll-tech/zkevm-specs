# JUMPI code

## Procedure

JUMP is an op code regarding flow control of evm. it pops two values at the top of the stack and conditionally changes program counter . 


### EVM behavior
Pop two EVM words `dest` and `cond` from the stack. then do the followings:  
1. check `cond` is zero 
 -   set pc = pc + 1
2. check `cond` is not zero 
 - check `dest` is within code length range
 - check `dest` is a JUMPDEST
 - check `dest` is not data section of PUSH*
 - set pc = `dest`

### Circuit behavior

1. Construct byte code table with tuple of (code_hash, index, bytecode, is_code) in each row, the table validity will be ensured by another byte code circuit.
2. basic constraints:
  - opId === OpcodeId(0x57)
  - gc + 2 (2 stack read)
  - pc = pc + 1 if `cond` is zero else `dest`
  - stack_pointer + 2
  - gas + 10 
  - 2 busmapping lookups + 1 byte code lookup if `cond` is non zero
3. Conditional constraint:  
adapter each case's selector with `cond` counts to support conditional 
group constraint: `case_selector.expr() * cond `.  

## Exceptions

1. stack underflow:   when stack is empty ` stack_pointer in [1023,1024]`
2. out of gas: remaining gas is not enough
3. invalid jump (AKA ErrInvalidJump):  
the `dest` is not JUMPDEST or not code or out of range
